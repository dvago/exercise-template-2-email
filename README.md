# Template 2 Email

RWD Exercise for Monica and Melisa.

Given the current Melisa's implementation of the **"Template 2 Email"** page, restructure the page in order to provide a semantic 
HTML markup and a responsive style.

## Layouts

The layouts are located within the `images/` folder

## Scope:

- Gain confidence of work within shared projects using the GIT flow
- Improve knowledge of semantic HTML markup
- Practice styling web pages with mobile-first in mind, deepening the knowledge of CSS

## Nice to have
- Add some ARIA-tag to improve the accessibility of the page 
  - Accessibility fundamentals: (https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/)
  - ARIA: (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)
  - Learn ARIA basics: (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics)

- Refactor the current javascript implementation without relying on jQuery library.
  - You might want to use a color picker written in Vanilla JS (ex. https://github.com/Sphinxxxx/vanilla-picker)
  
## Hints

- The `cyan` dashed boxes within the live template are `outline`
- The close button could be generated using a `+` rotated by `45deg`
